# 🍛 Indian Food Filtering Project (Mini Project #2)

This beginner-friendly project explores Indian food dishes using **Pandas** for filtering, sorting, and analysis.

---

## 📋 What’s in the Project:

- Created a DataFrame with 6 popular Indian dishes
- Added columns: `Type`, `Spice_Level`, `Calories`, `Meal_Time`
- Practiced multiple filters:
  - Dishes with calories > 400
  - Only North Indian dishes
  - High-spice dishes over 400 calories
  - Dishes not having medium spice
- Sorted dinner dishes by calories
- Added a new column for `Meal_Time`

---

## ✅ Skills Practiced:

- Filtering rows using multiple conditions
- Sorting data with `.sort_values()`
- Adding new columns to an existing DataFrame
- Writing clean, readable Pandas code

## 📁 File Included:

- `indian-food-filtering-project.ipynb`

## 💡 Why I Built This:

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **data filtering** in Pandas using a fun and familiar theme — Indian food!  
I’ll continue applying these skills to real-world datasets next.
