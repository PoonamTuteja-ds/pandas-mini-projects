# 📊 Pandas Mini Projects

Hello! I'm Poonam Tuteja 👋 and this is my beginner-friendly collection of **Pandas practice projects**.  
As I'm learning data analysis using Python, I'm building small mini projects to apply what I learn — and this repository will grow with me!

## 🪙 Project 1: Cryptocurrency Table (with Filters & Sorting)

In this project, I explored the prices and market caps of popular cryptocurrencies using **Pandas**.

### 🔍 What This Project Includes:
- Creating a DataFrame from scratch
- Sorting cryptocurrencies by price
- Filtering coins based on market cap and price
- Finding the average price
- Adding a **custom column for coin rankings**

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- How to create tables using `pd.DataFrame`
- How to use `.sort_values()` and `.head()`
- How to filter rows with conditions (`>`, `<`, `==`)
- How to calculate averages using `.mean()`

### 📋 Table Preview (Example)

| Name     | Price (USD) | Market Cap (Billion) | 
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Bitcoin  | 67240       | 1320                 | 
| Ethereum | 3520        | 420                  | 
| Ripple   | 0.51        | 27.3                 |

📌 This is part of my learning journey with Python and Pandas.  
I'll continue building and uploading more mini projects here as I grow.

Thanks for visiting! 😊
